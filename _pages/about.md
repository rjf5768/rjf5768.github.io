I'm a senior undergraduate student at The Pennsylvania State University studying Computer Science with a minor in Supply Chain and Information Science of Technology. I expect to graduate in May 2026.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Suman Saha at Penn State, where I work on research at the intersection of large language models and program analysis. My work has resulted in two preprints exploring whether LLMs can simulate symbolic execution and recover program semantics from obfuscated code.

Previously, I worked as a Software Developer Intern at Shanghai Meditation Network Technology Co., Ltd., where I contributed to feature development and system maintenance.

I am applying for PhD in the upcoming application cycles, please feel free to reach out to me!

Research Interests
======

My research interests broadly lie in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am currently focused on code intelligence and large language models for program analysis, but I am also interested in:

- Reasoning and verification in AI systems
- Neural network interpretability and robustness
- AI agents and autonomous systems
- Trustworthy and reliable AI
