excerpt: '**Rong Feng**, Vanisha Gupta, Vivek Patel, Viroopaksh Reddy Ernampati, Suman Saha<br><br>This paper investigates whether large language models can simulate symbolic execution outputs produced by tools like KLEE. We research program semantics and code security, focusing on deobfuscation, symbolic execution, and program equivalence. We designed preprocessing pipelines to automatically insert symbolic variables into C programs and compile to LLVM bitcode for analysis. We fine-tuned GPT-4o on a large dataset with KLEE artifacts to evaluate its ability to replicate path constraints and test case outputs.'
