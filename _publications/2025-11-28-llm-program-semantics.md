excerpt: '**Rong Feng**, Suman Saha<br><br>This paper presents a systematic evaluation of whether large language models can recover program semantics from obfuscated code. We designed and implemented a benchmark suite combining TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories with four obfuscation transformations: control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding. We fine-tuned multiple LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, Codestral, Ministral) under baseline and KLEE-enhanced training configurations using SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases.<br><br><img src="/images/111.jpg" alt="Overview" style="max-width:50%;">'
